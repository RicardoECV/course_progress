Welcome! This repository is a collection of everything I’ve learned and built during a 7-month course on web development. From basic HTML structure to backend development with PHP, this journey has helped me grow into a full-stack developer.

Technologies Used:

HTML – Structure and content of web pages

CSS – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript – Interactive elements and client-side logic

Python – Introduction to programming logic

PHP – Server-side scripting

SQL – Database design and querying

The repository is organized by modules.

A place to track my progress, share knowledge, and showcase what I’ve learned.
